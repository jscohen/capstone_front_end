## Technologies

YourDocs is a word processor that uses Ember.js and Express.js to run.  In ember, the client-side functionality is handled via routes, services and components.  ExpressJS provides RESTFUL routes for the API.

## General Approach
I am still working through things, but the approach is to have one document resource and have some word processing features on the client side.  A user should be able to create, read, update and delete their documents typed in the browser.  My stretch goal is to allow formatting in the client side and translation.

## Installation Instructions

Client Side:

On the command line, type in ember install followed by npm install.  You can type in ember serve to run the client side of the app.

## User Stories

1. I, as a user, want to be able to create documents to type my writing into.

2. I, as a user, want to be able to retrieve my past writing.

3. I as a user wish to delete writing that I don't like anymore by deleting documents.

4. (Stretch) I as a user want to be able to export my documents

5. (Stretch) I as a user want to be able to format and style my documents.
